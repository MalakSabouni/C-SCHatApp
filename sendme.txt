The stars

Stars are very hot and huge heavenly objects made up of very hot gases. They appears like 'dots' only because they are very very far away from us. Their light take millions of years to reach the earth.

The stars nearest to the earth is the sun itself. The next nearest star is Alpha Centuari. This is at distance of 4.3 light years from the earth.

The majority of the stars are compared to the distance of the sun, million of time farther away from us. It is for this reason that our nearest star, the sun, appears like a big spherical ball to us but the other stars appear like dot or point only.

The color of the star is determined by its surface temperatures. Stars, which have a lower temperature appears red. Those with a high temperature appears white and those with a very high temperature are blue. The size and color of the stars change with brightness and temperature. After the sun, it is the Sirius , which is the brightest star in the night sky.

We also know that earth revoles around the sun. The revolution of the earth around the sun and it rotation about it own axis, is the cause of the same stars rising four minutes earlier each day.

This implies that the overall set- up of the sky change every night. This change may not be noticeable in a day or week, but one can observe the difference over about a month.
