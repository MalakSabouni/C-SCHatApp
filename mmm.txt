The if statement if not data is equivalent to writing if data != "", while the empty string your server receives is b''. You have several options to fix it.

data = conn.recv(1024).decode() is the proper way to allocate the data sent by the client. You can now print(data) or compare data to an empty string.

If you still don't want to decode() your message you could change your if statement to if data != b'' or if data is not None.

Update
If it wasn't clear, your str(data) conversion causes the if statement to work unproperly, which is set to False without allowing you to break when a client disconnects.
